# Downloading a LLM Model from the Hugging Face Hub

To download a LLM (Language Model) from Hugging Face follow these steps:

## Downloading the LLM Model

1. Follow the installation instructions found at the [Ollama repository](https://github.com/ollama/ollama).

2. Go to the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/CodeLlama-70B-Instruct-GGUF/tree/main) and select the model you would like to use.
   For our experiments we decided to use the `<codellama-70b-instruct.Q5_K_M.gguf>` model.

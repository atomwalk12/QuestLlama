As an example, this guide will go through the steps to deploy [distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english) for text classification. \\n\\n## 1. Enter the Hugging Face Repository ID and your desired endpoint name:\\n\\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/hf-endpoints-documentation/main/assets/1_repository.png\" alt=\"select repository\" />\\n\\n## 2. Select your Cloud Provider and region. Initially, only AWS will be available as a Cloud Provider with the `us-east-1` and `eu-west-1` regions. We will add Azure soon, and if you need to test Endpoints with other Cloud Providers or regions, please let us know.\\n\\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/hf-endpoints-documentation/main/assets/1_region.png\" alt=\"select region\" />\\n\\n## 3. Define the [Security Level](security) for the Endpoint:\\n\\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/hf-endpoints-documentation/main/assets/1_security.png\" alt=\"define security\" />\\n\\n## 4. Create your Endpoint by clicking **Create Endpoint**. By default, your Endpoint is created with a medium CPU (2 x 4GB vCPUs with Intel Xeon Ice Lake) The cost estimate assumes the Endpoint will be up for an entire month, and does not take autoscaling into account.\\n\\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/hf-endpoints-documentation/main/assets/1_create_cost.png\" alt=\"create endpoint\" />\\n\\n## 5. Wait for the Endpoint to build, initialize and run which can take between 1 to 5 minutes.\\n\\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/hf-endpoints-documentation/main/assets/overview.png\" alt=\"overview\" />\\n\\n## 6. Test your Endpoint in the overview with the Inference widget üèÅ üéâ!\\n\\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/hf-endpoints-documentation/main/assets/1_inference.png\" alt=\"run inference\" />\\n',\n",

While it correctly states that large files can't be synced and recommends removing them if Git-LFS is not used, it does not provide a direct or straightforward answer. Additionally, the response does not refer to any of the specified documents and thus cannot accurately claim to be based on them. This shows that the assistant either does not understand or is unable to process the context. The provided answer deviates significantly from the actual instruction, leading to misinformation.

While it includes several important aspects from the original text, such as replacing the self-attention sublayers with simple linear transformations and Fourier Transform, some parts may be considered as incorrect or misleading, specifically about how BERT's bi-directional self-attention layers have to be changed to uni-directional. Furthermore, there is an issue with the understanding of how BERT heavily relies on the global self-attention block and thus suffers large memory footprint and computation cost. So, the overall score is 3 based on the rubric's scoring criteria that a response is \"mostly correct\" but has some inaccuracies or misleading information. [RESULT] 3\n",
      "This response has been given a score of 1 because it fails to accurately and correctly answer the question posed. According to the score rubric, this is because \"The response is completely incorrect, inaccurate, and/or not factual\". The reference answer correctly states that every bug fix should be accompanied by a test that failed before the fix and passes afterwards, which is accurate as per the reference documents 1, 3, and 2. However, the assistant's response completely misunderstood this principle, instead stating that the question is unclear due to a lack of information in the given documents. This misinterpretation is both inaccurate and unhelpful to someone looking for an answer on what kind of tests should accompany bug fixes in Gradio.  The assistant's response is also incorrect because it did not refer to any source document for justifying the type of test required, contrary to the requirements outlined in the reference documents.  Therefore, this response fails to provide accurate information about the topic as per the instructions given and thus scores a score of 1 according to the rubric. [RESULT] 1\n",

According to the score rubric, it should contain a detailed explanation on how to enable mixed precision using the `mixed_precision='fp16'` argument, however, you completely overlooked this crucial aspect while describing how the library works. You instead went on to provide details about other parts of the code like the `DataLoader`, gradient checkpointing etc., which were not requested. Your answer doesn't adhere to any standards of accuracy and completeness based on the score rubric, as you failed to provide a detailed description of how mixed precision training is achieved through passing an argument while initializing the Accelerator.

While it references some of the parameters of LLaMA models mentioned in the given documents (Document 0 and Document 3), it doesn't clearly indicate the parameter range of LLaMA models which is from 7B to 65B as stated in the instruction. Furthermore, there are errors in the information presented; for instance, while mentioning LLaMA's model sizes, the response refers to LLaMa, not LLaMA (an entirely different thing). The reference to GPT-3 being outperformed by a small LLaMA model is misleading since there was no clear reference to GPT-3 in the original text. There are also inaccuracies in stating that LLaMA models were 'recently introduced'.

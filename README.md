**QuestLlama: An Autonomous Agent in Minecraft**

Welcome to QuestLlama, a project inspired by Voyager that aims to create an alternative to paid subscription-based AI models like ChatGPT. Our goal is to build an autonomous agent in Minecraft using open-source LLaMA 3 models.

**Project Overview**

QuestLlama combines the power of LLaMA 3 models with the popular Minecraft game to create a unique and interactive experience. Our agent is designed to explore, learn, and adapt to its environment without human intervention. By leveraging the capabilities of LLaMA 3 models, we can create an autonomous agent that can perform complex tasks and explore Minecraft.

**Key Features**

* Autonomous exploration: QuestLlama's agent explores the Minecraft world, acquires new skills, and makes discoveries without human intervention.
* Open-source LLaMA 3 models: We utilize open-source LLaMA 3 models to power our agent, making it a cost-effective alternative to paid subscription-based AI models.
* Interactive experience: QuestLlama provides an immersive and interactive experience in Minecraft, allowing users to engage with the agent and observe its behavior.

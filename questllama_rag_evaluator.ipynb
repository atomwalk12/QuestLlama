    "# The model has access to several predefined helper functions that are designed to simplify routine operations and enhance code efficiency. While these functions are available for use, their application should be contextually appropriate to the specific task being performed:\n",
    "# - `mineBlock(bot, name, count)`: Collects specified blocks, suitable for tasks involving resource collection.\n",
    "# - `craftItem(bot, name, count)`: Crafts items, applicable for tasks requiring item assembly.\n",
    "# - `smeltItem(bot, name, count)`: Manages item smelting, relevant for tasks involving material processing.\n",
    "# - `placeItem(bot, name, position)`: Places items, useful for building and construction tasks.\n",
    "# - `killMob(bot, name, timeout)`: Handles mob engagement and elimination, necessary for combat-related tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "# It is not expected that all these functions will be used in every solution; rather, their use should be dictated by the requirements of the specific task at hand. The absence of a function in a solution where it is not relevant should not negatively impact the evaluation. The emphasis of the evaluation should be on the effective use of these functions when they are applicable to the task, ensuring they are not marked as undefined if used and not penalizing their non-use when they are not relevant to the task objectives.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# TODO Razvan simplify the prompt\n",
    "# ###Guidelines for Code Writing:\n",
    "# 1. The main function must be an async function that takes `bot` as its sole argument.\n",
    "# 2. Internal variables and setup must be confined within the function to ensure reusability and independence from external state changes.\n",
    "# 3. Progress should be communicated through `bot.chat` to indicate milestones or status updates within the task.\n",
    "# 4. Exploration and item collection must adapt to changing conditions, employing `exploreUntil` with random directions to avoid predictable patterns.\n",
    "# 5. Maintain a strict operational boundary with a maximum distance of 32 blocks for finding blocks or entities.\n",
    "# 6. Avoid the use of infinite loops, recursive functions, and event listeners to prevent performance degradation and unpredictable behavior.\n",
    "# 7. The function's name should reflect its purpose clearly and be indicative of the task it performs.\n",

It correctly identified that the code does not complete the task as it only provides helper functions for other tasks. The plan outlined steps to create an async function named `mineWoodLog` and use the `findBlock`, `collectBlock`, and `exploreUntil` functions to mine wood logs. The response also emphasized the importance of checking resources before mining and naming the function in a meaningful way. However, it did not provide a complete code example like the reference response, which would have made it more comprehensive. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4"
